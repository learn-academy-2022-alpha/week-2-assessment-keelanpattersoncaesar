# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: I think a parameter is a placeholder for a datatype. An Argument is the part of the parameter where you can call for certain actions. For example, ".map()" would be a parameter and inside of the parenthesis would be where the argument goes.

  Researched answer: After looking it up, I learned that parameters are variables that are passed into functions (inside the function's parenthesis). Arguments are the values that are passed into a function WHEN it is called 
  (For example: "$function(INSERT ARGUMENT HERE)"). 



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: If you put a parameter inside of the parenthesizes of .map(), you can manipulate that value in any way you'd like.

  Researched answer: After researching the answer, I learned that .map() takes three parameters: value, index position, and array. The value parameter is usually the one most people use (and is the only required parameter). Index can be used to calculate things using the array's index position. Lastly, array can be used in a similar way as index, except it can take other arrays as a parameter.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: .Map returns an array of the same length and .filter returns an array of a smaller length.

  Researched answer: .Map will return a new array and allows developers to call functions on each index position in the array. Similarly, .filter does the same thing but instead removes values that do not pass the given argument.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A method can be described as an action that is performed on an object. A function is a set of code that performs an action when invoked with ()

  Researched answer: A method is a function that can be stored objects. Some common built-in methods are .toUpperCase, .filter, and .sort. A method can also be created by the developer. This type of method is a function definition that is stored as a value. This allows that value to be called upon with function.methodName().



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: It is the process of taking an object and calling upon the values to a new variable

  Researched answer: Object destructuring is exactly what it sounds like: taking an object and working backwards to assign it's values to a different variable. Object destructuring also works on arrays. It is also possible to destruct multiple values in the same argument using curly braces.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting is moving code to the top to prevent errors when trying to run the code.

  Researched answer: Hoisting is when the compiler seemingly moves all declarations to the top of the page before it executes the code. It is best practice for developers to do this on their own, but not necessary. Hoisting is important because some code won't execute without its variables being declared initially. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Class Inheritance is when a child takes on the attributes of a parent object

2. React: Created by Facebook/Meta. It's a JS Library which helps developers build interactive User interfaces 

3. React state: State is similar to props, except that it can actively manage and update data on the fly. 

4. React lifecycle methods: Lifecycle methods include constructor(), render(), setState() and more. They basically are responsible for starting, executing, rendering and ending the code.

5. DOM: Stands for Document Object Model; It allows your browser to render the changes made in react immediately. Changes can be tracked in the console of your browser
